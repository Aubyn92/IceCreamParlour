            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>How do I get to Hamilton Island?</h4>
              <p>Flights leave multiple times everyday from Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Cairns. Hamilton Island is the only Whitsundays Island with its own commercial airport. Book with Jetstar, Virgin Australia or Qantas. Alternatively, ferries can be taken from Shute Harbour, or Airlie Beach direct to the island.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>Where is the parlour, and what time are the opening hours?</h4>
              <p>We are on Front Street, the main shopping street. You'll find us across the road from the Cruise Whitsundays boat jetty. The parlour is open from 7am to 10:30pm everyday of the year except for Christmas Day; our hours are 10am to 6pm on that day. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>What's there to do on the island?</h4>
              <p>If you enjoy the beach, the outdoors and sunshine, you're in luck. There's an array of hiking trails starting from the end of Catseye beach. Hike to the more secluded beaches such as Coral Cove, Escape Beach and Hideaway Bay. <br>Hire beach equipment or
                take a swim in the staff swimming pool. <br>A staff bar is nearby and it hosts various activities throughout the week. <br>There's a sports gym available with yoga classes etc. <br>The island itself has many beautiful spots to just relax and read, or do whatever you choose to do in your downtime. It's a lovely place to be with gorgeous weather almost all year round!

            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>Where is our accommodation, who do I live with, and what are the expenses involved?
              </h4>
              <p>6 Westview Lane. Cocos Apartments is the name. You will share a room with one other girl who also works at the parlour. It's the Ice Cream Parlour house! Two single beds in each room. There are two rooms, so typically 3-4 girls living in the house at a time. No more than 4. The rent is taken out of your pay check automatically each week. The amount will be specified
                 in your contract upon arrival. Expenses like water, gas and electricity are calculated and subtracted typically when one person leaves and is replaced by another, and the total bill is split evenly between all girls.

              <h4>Which kind of contract am I on, and how does the pay check work?
              </h4>
              <p>You are on a casual contract. Please don't hesitate to enquire further if you have any questions about what that entails. You’ll be paid every Wednesday, and the pay rate will be included in your contract upon your arrival.
                </p>

            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>Do I have a uniform?</h4>
              <p>Yes, we provide you with a work t-shirt and you can wear shorts or pants of your own choice, as well as covered shoes. Sneakers are a good choice.
               <br> Hair is to be worn back, please. Minimal jewellery too. See further details in the Terms of Employment section.

            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>Is there anything in particular I should bring with me to the island?</h4>
              <p>Sunscreen, sunnies, jandals/ sandals/ thongs/ flip flops, sun hat :) ...Summer clothes, summer shoes, summer everything! <br>It does get a little cold in winter though, even here, so be prepped for that if you'll be around at that time. <br>Things can be quite expensive on the island so it's best to bring a fresh stock of your toiletries with you instead of buying them here. <br>
                You can always head to the mainland now and then, or grab something online and have it sent.   </p>

            <div class="faq-content">
              <h4>How do I know which shifts I will be working, and how many days off do I get?</h4>
              <p>Your shifts will either be 10am to 6pm or 2pm to 10:30pm, with both shifts having a mandatory one hour, unpaid, lunch/dinner break. The roster is put up on the bulletin board at work every week and runs 2-3 weeks ahead, so you can see which shifts you're rostered on for ahead of time. <br>You'll typically get two days off per week, though in busier seasons this can reduce to one. It really depends on the people and time of year. <br>Summer is usually a busy season, as are school holidays.
